# Ansible Role: Docker with filedrop

This is a demo of using https://github.com/lod/filedrop to orchestrate an ansible role.

It is a fork of https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-docker/ I recommend using that rather than this, it is better tested and maintained.

This was a useful implementation test but isn't a great example of the filedrop functionality.
